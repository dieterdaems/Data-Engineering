SaberTail,,"&gt; Only in December of 2022 did scientists at the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory announce that they had achieved the first recorded fusion reaction with a net energy gain<p>We&#x27;ve been achieving fusion reactions with net energy gain since the 1950s, when hydrogen bombs were developed. And, on top of that, the achievement they&#x27;re talking about was more energy out than light energy put in from lasers. The NIF lasers are not anywhere close to 100% efficient at converting energy to light, and so it was not actually net energy positive.<p>NIF is not going to lead to fusion power. That&#x27;s not the point. Fusion bombs are primarily an engineering problem. There&#x27;s lots of plasma physics going on that is very difficult to simulate with a computer, and you need real world data to inform the simulations to make sure they&#x27;re working properly. That&#x27;s what NIF is for. Instead of having to blow up a nuclear bomb, and violating test ban treaties, NIF can produce that data. And with the PR shine of tying it to fusion energy.",1714834845,,40258169,40257843,comment,

Personally i just wanted to connect and play music without the judgement (tho do want you to be able to actually play an instrument fairly well .. strum chords on guitar and lets sing along as we strum together).<p>I posted songs i wrote where professional singers were singing them and those got people reaching out.  Their messages were like good song and did you sing that (i noted i did not) but they became disinterested when they truly realized i was not the singer.,1714775907,,40253133,40250557,comment,

TacticalCoder,,"&gt; I don&#x27;t feel this is safe enough. I also feel we could do better by optimizing images on the BE, or creating thumbnails for videos.<p>Yeah definitely. Even optimizing the vids. I just spend time writing scripts to convert, in parallel, a <i>massive</i> amount of JPG, PNG, PDFs, <i>mp4</i> videos and even some HEIC files customers sent of their ID (identity card or passport, basically). I did shrink them all to reasonable size.<p>The issue is: if you let user do anything, you&#x27;ll have that one user, once in a while, that shall send a 30 MB JPG of his ID. Recto. Than Verso.<p>Then the signed contracts: imagine a user printing a 15 pages contract, signing&#x2F;paraphing every single page, then not scanning it but taking a 30 MB picture, with his phone, in diagonal, in perspective. And sending all the files individually.<p>After a decade, this represented a <i>massive</i> amount of data.<p>It was beautiful to crush that data to anywhere from 1&#x2F;4th to 1&#x2F;10th of its size and see all the cores working at full speed, compressing everything to reasonable sizes.<p>Many sites and 3rd party identity verification services (whatever these are called) do put limit on the allowed size per document, which already helps.<p>In my case I simply used ImageMagick (mogrify), ffmpeg (to convert to x265) and... GhostScript (good old <i>gs</i> command). PDFs didn&#x27;t have to be searchable for text so there&#x27;s that too (and often already weren&#x27;t at least not easily, due to users taking pictures then creating a PDF out of the picture).<p>This was not in Amazon S3 but basically all in Google Workspace: it was for a SME to make everything leaner, snapper, quicker, smaller. Cheaper too (no need to buy additional storage).<p>Backups of all the originals, full size, files were of course made too but these shall probably never be needed.<p>In my case I downloaded <i>everything</i>. Both to create backups (offsite, offline) and to crush everything locally (simply on an AMD 7700X: powerful enough as long as you don&#x27;t have months of videos to encode).<p>&gt; Anybody have experience with any of this? I imagine having a big team and dedicated services for media processing could work, but what about small teams?<p>I did it as a one-person job. Putting limits in place or automatically resizing, right after upload, a 30 MB JPG file which you know if of an ID card to a 3 MB JPG file doesn&#x27;t require a team.<p>Same for invoking the following to downsize vids:<p><pre><code>    ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vcodec libx265 -crf 28 output.mp4    (I think that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using)
</code></pre>
My script&#x27;s logic were quite simple: files above a certain size were candidates for downsizing then downsizing then if the output was successful and took less than a certain amount of time, use that, otherwise keep the original.<p>I didn&#x27;t bother verifying that the files visually matched (once again: all the originals are available on offline backups in case something went south and some file is really badly needed) but I could have done that too. There was a blog post posted here a few years ago where a book author would visually compare thumbnails of different revisions of his book, to make sure that nothing changed too much between two minor revisions. I considered doing something similar but didn&#x27;t bother.<p>Needless to say my client is <i>very</i> happy with the results and the savings.<p>YMMV but worked for me and worked for my client.",1714827004,,40257284,40221210,comment,

mywittyname,,"I was a karate practitioner and instructor in my youth.  Board breaking is really, really easy. The key is the boards designed for breaking are cut in their weakest orientation.  Wood is incredibly strong going with the fibers, even a pine board is very hard to break long ways using a sledge hammer.  However, if it&#x27;s cut on its short axis, it&#x27;s incredibly easy to break.  Most people, even children don&#x27;t need any guidance beyond, &quot;punch through the board&quot; to be successful.  Breaking boards is more mental than physical.  If a student is struggling or a novice, the person holding the board can hold their hands a little wider to make it easier to break.<p>Concrete is more difficult, but there&#x27;s still a trick to it.  The blocks you use for breaking have a bit of flex to them, but are also extremely brittle.  So just getting it to flex just a small amount will cause them to break in half.  That&#x27;s also why you place spacers between stacks of bricks or wood.  You&#x27;re leveraging the flex of the material to break it, and stacking them without spacers makes too rigid to break.<p>In short, this stuff is 90% magic trick.",1714768973,,40252171,40251317,comment,"[40253244, 40252276, 40255418, 40252197, 40253527, 40253180, 40252875, 40252640, 40252342, 40252940, 40252911, 40252403]"

kadoban,,"&gt; This is where things start to get interesting.

justneedaname,,"This reminds me of the very first project that I worked on, a warning system for rail trackside workers. There had been numerous case studies of near misses, injuries and even fatalities.<p>The system currently in place at the time was, unbelievably, two people (in the case of a bi-directional line) stood downline within earshot of the main crew. When they saw a train approaching they would blow whistles and wave a flag, the workers would then move out of the way until the train passed. Yeah I also couldn&#x27;t believe that such an archaic system was still in use - this was in 2019 mind.<p>The company in charge of managing the railway lines reached out to our company and a few others to have us tender on a new design to help protect workers and reduce near misses. Our research led us to an existing system developed by a company in Switzerland which we essentially planned to modify for our national network, as there are differences in how railway lines are signalled across different regions. It consisted of units that could be placed periodically downline of the work site and would alarm when a train was approaching by use of real-time train location data.<p>The main issue we faced though was how to ensure an accurate reading that gave enough time to vacate the line whilst not being excessive, as research suggested workers may believe it to be a false positive if nothing approached after a couple of minutes.
To understand why this is a difficult problem it first helps to understand how traffic within a railway line is managed.<p>The railway network is split into what is known as blocks, these are discrete sections of track separated by axle counters. Without a train the two sections of track are electronically separate, when one passes over a circuit is completed and the train&#x27;s position can know be known to that exact location at that exact time. However these readings are discreet, with resolution of the trains position only being as good as the number of axle counters present on the line. This results in some tricky estimating of when &quot;impact&quot; will happen. Train speed is another metric that can be used in conjunction but again you only know the speed read at the last axle counter, anything could have happened between the last reading and &quot;now&quot;.<p>In the end our solution was to assume maximum line speed and warn when this would be within 30s of the worksite. We created a demo that worked flawlessly and the client was visibly impressed. However they then wanted a proposal, cost and everything else for the next phase within 2 weeks - so we had to pull out as we weren&#x27;t able to produce it. This was a real shame for me as I look back on this project with fond memories, one of the few projects where we were essentially left to figure it out. Already in my short career (&lt;5y) I&#x27;ve been fortunate enough to work on some interesting projects and gain interesting stories to tell...",1714727314,,40245655,40233736,comment,

photochemsyn,,"This is about developing metal-organic materials that absorb CO2 under one set of conditions and release it under a different set of conditions.  The whole goal here is to generate a stream of 100% pure CO2 starting with ~400 ppm CO2 - meaning if you want 1 liter of pure CO2 at room temperature and pressure, you need to process a minimum of 2500 liters of air - and likely quite a bit more as you are not going to be 100% efficient.<p>Making this work is all about minimizing the energy (and thus economic) cost of this first step.  Then you need to reduce (add hydrogen and remove oxygen) the CO2 and start building other products - methanol, long-chain hydrocarbons, etc. (that&#x27;s shipping and jet&#x2F;rocket fuel, respectively).  But why stop there?  If you want long-term stable materials, converting the CO2 into carbon fiber is a good option - more sci-fi is a diamond endpoint, which takes a lot of energy, but has many uses.<p>This will have minimal effect on atmospheric CO2 unless fossil fuel extraction and combustion is eliminated from the energy mix - but it does point to how human civilization can do material and fuel production without having to mine carbon from the earth or cut down forests.

The Hole Hawg is as intuitive as a power drill gets: pull the trigger, spinny end spins. You just have to be careful that it doesn&#x27;t snag on anything or it will spin <i>you</i> instead of the drillbit.<p>There&#x27;s a joke that goes &quot;Unix is a very user friendly OS; it&#x27;s just picky about its friends.&quot; And the truth behind that is that Unix -- what Stephenson called the Hole Hawg of operating systems -- works in a way that&#x27;s fairly straightforward and understandable -- or it was for a 70s&#x2F;80s OS. But like the industrial-strength drill it is very powerful and will do exactly as instructed -- even if that will harm you or your work if sufficient care is not exercised in its use.<p>So a lot of what we call &quot;ease of use&quot; comes in the form of guardrails that protect the ignorant from themselves -- like the torque setting on the drill -- or features which were designed for particular use cases and don&#x27;t make much sense in the general case. My favorite example is the percent key on a calculator, which works in a way that completely violates my mathematician&#x27;s intuition for percentages. Like I&#x27;d expect to be able to express 30% by typing 3, 0, % and getting 0.3. And on a scientific calculator that&#x27;s exactly what you might get. But on a normie&#x27;s calculator, the percent key works <i>completely</i> differently: it serves as a substitute for the = key, except it takes the second operand as a percentage of the first operand. It&#x27;s good for calculating tax, tips, and discounts -- and almost <i>nothing else</i>. Like 6% sales tax on an item costing $15.87 would be 15.87 + 6 % . And a 15% discount on a $23.44 item would be 23.44 - 15 %.<p>If you want to be the next Apple, stop to think about the tasks you envision normies doing with your thing and build around those tasks, making them stupidly easy, <i>at the expense</i> of a cohesive general system design. Of course you may miss and become the next Rabbit, but big risks yield big rewards.<p>I dunno where I&#x27;m going with this.

It turned out the performance impact of running fewer blades was minimal, so we cut the number down, allowing our machinist to use larger, less fragile tools. Machine time dropped to less than a day, which was a significant win for turbine cost and machine time.

One of the drivers of malignant mesothelioma (which is caused by inhalation of asbestos) is a chronic state of inflammation caused by the inability to remove or degrade the asbestos fibers.<p>But in ovarian cancer the major mechanisms are not inflammatory in nature.

ssl-3,,"I once ran a WWIV BBS for a couple-three years.<p>My cousin got me started:  We&#x27;d been on a camping trip a few hours away, and he spent the whole way back telling me all about how amazing BBSs were, and also how cool it was to play games like Trade Wars 2002 amongst other real people.<p>I liked computers, and I liked reading computer magazines, and I knew of things like Compuserve, but prior to that I didn&#x27;t really know anything about how BBSs worked or that we had any that were local to us.<p>My 12th birthday was going to happen in a few weeks, so I politely requested a thing called a &quot;modem&quot; and...that actually happened.  A 2400BPS internal ISA card that was around $100 at the local indy computer shop.<p>So I called my cousin up and he was kind of a dick.  His original energy was gone, and it seemed that the BBS scene he was raving about wasn&#x27;t really a thing he wanted to help me with, but he did give me one BBS phone number to get started with.<p>And from that singular BBS, I learned that we had about 5 BBSs in the local calling area.<p>And it was great.  12-year-old me met some cool people (many of whom are still good friends), and it was a lot of fun hanging out, downloading software, and sometimes using the message forums.<p>And it was also cool because my parents soon saw a need to get me my own phone line -- probably so my older sisters would stop being hateful about me using the regular phone line.<p>Except:  It also sucked.  Most of these boards were standalone, and I wanted more than that.<p>So, armed with the only computer I had (a 10MHz XT clone) and a phone line, I downloaded a copy of WWIV and made it work.<p>I got networked message subs working, so people from far-away places could have conversations through my own little BBS.  I got my own door games (like my own copy of TW2002) working.  I chatted with and met all kinds of new people, only one or two of whom ever got convicted of child molestation.<p>Weird times.  And, generally, good times -- man, it was a lot of fun being a young sysop.<p>(And I won&#x27;t drop a bomb like that without a description.  My BBS&#x27;s users were generally at least a decade older than I was.  Maybe some of them saw that as an advantage.  I met a bunch of them, and treated them all the same:  We&#x27;d usually hang out, talk shop, and trade hardware and software.  Sometimes I&#x27;d help them with their computer issues, and sometimes they&#x27;d help me with mine.  Sometimes we&#x27;d chat about music or movies.  It always seemed very platonic.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until I became a lot older that I realized that some of my BBS users were treating <i>me</i> differently than my other users were; that some of them were very forthcoming with small unexpected gifts that weren&#x27;t based on my actual BBS needs, for instance.<p>Because of my particular bent of autism, I soundly rejected all of these advances just as easily as I did when I had an age-appropriate college-girl girlfriend try to give me a key to her apartment a decade or so later (where I&#x27;d been spending about exactly as much time as I should have been spending, which was most of my time):<p>I mean, I remember a conversation that went something like this with that girlfriend, in her apartment:  &quot;What?  Why do I need a key to your place?  Listen, if I want to stop by I&#x27;ll just stop by -- and if you&#x27;re not home, then I&#x27;ll try to call you on your cell phone or something.  It&#x27;s OK.  I don&#x27;t need this key -- why would I come over if you&#x27;re not even home?  But thanks?  I think?  Here, you look confused; why don&#x27;t you just keep this key as a spare for yourself?&quot;  (And then I handed the key back for the last time, because I just didn&#x27;t understand the concept of the thing she was literally trying to convey.  She seemed upset, and I didn&#x27;t understand why, but she got over it.)<p>And a lot of my BBS friends -- of all ages -- would stop by unannounced.  It was the 90s; it wasn&#x27;t always a thing to call first and texting didn&#x27;t exist.  It was normal to just show up at someone&#x27;s house.<p>But the difference between the BBS friends who are still (30+ years later) and the BBS friends who went to prison is simple:<p>The BBS friends who are still friends today were real people, and we&#x27;d help eachother out with stuff just like we still do 30 years hence.  Sometimes it&#x27;d be at their place or my place, but we just treated eachother as peers.  We&#x27;d do things like go check on our other friends and run errands.  These peers haven&#x27;t ever come to me with unexpected gifts unless it was some windfall of disused hardware from an upgrade that we&#x27;d probably been planning for weeks or months.  Sometimes, we&#x27;d get some food together or share a meal if it was time to eat, but that&#x27;s not too dissimilar from how we still act together today.  They treated me as a peer, and I them as a peer, despite the age gap.  Nothing weird has ever happened with these folks.  Not even a little bit.<p>But some BBS &quot;friends&quot; who sometimes stopped by were not real people:  They never wanted anything from me, it didn&#x27;t seem -- all they wanted to do was give me gifts, and it was never mutual.  It was only sometimes even BBS- or computer- related.  They&#x27;d show up with music on CD (which was not cheap), and be all like &quot;Oh, you like it?  Just go ahead and keep it.&quot;  They&#x27;d bring gift certificates for ice cream or something.  One time, a guy shoved a semi-proper porn magazine between (&quot;Shaved&quot;, circa 1992 or 1993) in between the mattresses of my bed while I wasn&#x27;t watching, which I found weeks later.<p>I rejected these gifts just because I did not earn these gifts:  While I had no problem trading some computer work for a carton of Camel Filters at age 13, I definitely wasn&#x27;t going to take a carton of Camels that I did not earn.  My real-people BBS users did ever not give me anything unless it was obvious they owed me something, and the weird-fucker BBS users never wanted to do anything than give me gifts.<p>So, like that girlfriend&#x27;s apartment key:  I wasn&#x27;t <i>owed</i> that key.  It didn&#x27;t feel mutual.  I wasn&#x27;t owed a key to her place, and I wasn&#x27;t owed any free fucking ice cream or CDs or computer gear from random old men, either -- they all seemed like out-of-band constructs that should be avoided.<p>Rejected, and rejected.<p>(And not that I&#x27;m bitter or anything, Micheal; I just want to be fair.  If you ever get out of prison for all of those six-year-old boys you were so fond of, I&#x27;d like to have one singular, lasting chat about that porn you left under my bed.)",1714818471,,40256470,40254080,comment,

retrac,,"&gt; While stories such as Beauty and the Beast and Rumplestiltskin were first written down in the 17th and 18th century, the researchers found they originated “significantly earlier”<p>There are thematic similarities between the ancient Indo-European religions.  In the Germanic branch, there are the Norns, three female beings responsible for the fates of humanity.  There are the three Moirai, the Fates, in Greek mythology.  There are the three mothers, also responsible for humanity&#x27;s fate, in Celtic mythology.  Fifteen hundred years later, there are three &quot;weird sisters&quot; in Macbeth.<p>These cultures shared substantial mythology.  Greek mythology c 500 BC and Norse mythology c 800 AD have some two thousand years of separation between the branches, and yet substantial common elements - themes, story elements if you wish - remain.  Of course, some degree of exchange was going on the whole time.  It&#x27;s not like these themes were preserved in isolation.  The ancients themselves often noticed these connections - and sometimes made connections where there actually weren&#x27;t any historically, e.g. between Egyptian and Greek gods.<p>I am reminded of two ancient novels.  Apuleius&#x27;s Metamorphoses, and Lucian&#x27;s True Story.  Both are, essentially, fantasy novels - satirical fantasy novels, highly aware of the existing mythological and fantastical traditions of their time, and they rip them apart.<p>In the Metamorphoses by Apuleius (a reference to Ovid&#x27;s very serious treatment of Roman mythology in the also-titled Metamorphoses) the protagonist (spoilers!) very much wishes to become a wizard and gets himself accidentally turned into a sentient donkey - who is promptly sold to a disputable cult leader, and then the comical misfortunes really begin.  To the modern eye it&#x27;s almost impossible to <i>not</i> read it as placing a Roman noble in the body of a beast of burden, but with the soul of a man, and interpreting it as a critique of slavery, while telling funny stories, commenting on Roman beliefs, and indeed, making fun of many of the fantastical themes common at the time.  Though if the slavery commentary is really what Apuleius intended is controversial; he may not have seen the irony we see and may have just been having fun.<p>Lucian&#x27;s <i>True Story</i> is just completely over the top, it starts with being lost in the Atlantic ocean and washing up on a tropical magical island, and ends with a war with the inhabitants of the Moon.<p>I bring them up because, having come relatively later to the classics, reading them for the first time as an adult, I remember being constantly surprised with a sense of novelty yet familiarity.

Take 275 tales. These can be found in any specialist ‘Tales of Magic’ delicatessen or curiosity shop.<p>2. Separate the yolks from the whites. In other words the presence or absence of these tales in 50 Indo-European speaking populations.<p>3. Mix with a smattering of jargon and statistics. I found the paper to be written in a statistical analysis style, therefore not very accessible.<p>4. While the cake is in the oven draw some language trees. These indicate how populations have historically come into contact over time (population dispersal and the diversification of linguistic lineages).<p>5. Remove from the oven and cool. Ice the cake by skimming over debates of written versus oral narrative, and the distinctions or overlaps between them.<p>The written-oral debate acknowledges that there is a difficulty in tracing oral stories because tales are so easily transportable by travellers. There has been interaction of oral and written texts overtime, with one informing the other (Bottingheimer 2009, 2014). This basically means that what is an oral folktale, and each tales origins is unclear.<p>For example, different renditions of Arabian Nights indicated that translators created new stories inspired from oral and literary traditions (Warner 2012: 18). While this demonstrates some of the issues with the paper’s source materials it also illustrates how fearless Graça da Silva and Tehrani (2016) were trying to tackle the complex subject of oral folklore utilising new methodologies.<p>6. To finish the cake, sprinkle the results with statistics to see whether the 275 tales were more likely to spread generation to generation or across geographical areas due to migration, trade, and encounters between groups of people.<p>7.

I personally just told them to do it. Too much of a legal liability for both of parties.<p>But capturing all of the details of the history of present illness (HPI), patient medical history, review of systems, physical exam, procedures (if any) and medical decision making during patient visit can be a time consuming issue.

Ambulance chasers can easily call out these inconsistent details between doctor notes, patient outcomes, and cross check with nursing notes.<p>Additionally, this caused cases to be billed incorrectly or “down coded” as well.<p>I don’t agree with allowing private companies unfettered&#x2F;unregulated access to what is considered private medical information.

MostlyStable,,"Home gardeners seem like a pretty good option here. For more regular vegetables, this is already a thing that exists with seed libraries and exchanges, and programs that preserve heirloom varietals and sell the seeds to gardeners. Buying these seeds is basically just a way to help pay for the continued cultivation by the breeder (unfortunately, unless you <i>really</i> know what you are doing and are quite careful, preserving a specific variety on your own in a home garden is difficult-verging-on-impossible, despite what 1000 online guides to &quot;seed saving&quot; will tell you).<p>The harder thing is the grains, since those typically require so much more work to get from the plant to the plate. I&#x27;ve looked into growing my own wheat before (I already have a large garden and have enough space that I could theoretically grow enough wheat to cover a substantial portion of my annual flour use), but the small scale&#x2F;DIY options for threshing, sorting, grinding, and sifting are just not quite practical (for the level of effort I&#x27;m willing to put in, which I&#x27;m quite sure is higher than most home gardeners).<p>If a small scale solution to harvesting and processing wheat can be made relatively cheap and simple, I&#x27;d bet you could get home gardeners to support the continued cultivation of these varieties in the same way that they frequently support heirloom tomatoes etc.<p>Again, to be very clear, the gardeners themselves are (mostly) not doing the preserving. The plants home gardeners grow are a dead-end genetically (usually not being preserved at all, and even when they are, almost certainly representing mixes of several different varieties), but buy purchasing seeds from the larger scale growers, they are paying to support the continued cultivation of those varieties.",1714680186,,40240803,40237947,comment,"[40241303, 40243326, 40241854]"

vvanders,,"&gt; ... and frankly I really like just plain vanilla Lua.

10000truths,,"&gt; However, piccolo works very hard to guarantee that piccolo::Executor::step returns in a bounded amount of time, even without the cooperation of the running Lua code.<p>The issue is that there exist ways to make a single bytecode instruction take an unbounded amount of time to execute. For example, Lua&#x27;s &quot;string.find()&quot; is implemented in native code. The interpreter only sees a single OP_CALL opcode, so it will count it as 1 instruction executed. But the <i>actual</i> execution time of the native implementation of string.find() is dependent on its inputs, which are not only variable length strings, but can be maliciously crafted to run in exponential time. Here&#x27;s an example, shamelessly stolen from Mike Pall himself:<p><pre><code>  string.find(string.rep(&quot;a&quot;, 50), string.rep(&quot;a?&quot;, 50)..string.rep(&quot;a&quot;, 50))
</code></pre>
The only way to solve this is to track execution time <i>within</i> the native code as well (i.e. make them fuel-aware), and ensure that they abort immediately if they exhaust the fuel.",1714700112,,40243131,40239029,comment,[40243646]

Similarly—again sans proof—I&#x27;ve always assumed that that consciousness in other creatures would manifest itself in significantly different ways than it does in humans.<p>I&#x27;ve owned dogs and even as a kid I refused to believe that they were just automatons acting without being conscious and aware of their actions. One of my dogs in particular could read my actions and emotions probably better than I could myself and it&#x27;s hard to conceive let alone believe that he wasn&#x27;t self-aware. Unless we&#x27;ve absolute proof to the contrary, it just makes sense to assume most if not all creatures have some degree of sentience.<p>That said, there has to be a scaling factor here. There just isn&#x27;t sufficient neurons in say an ant&#x27;s brain to register the complex emotions of a human and it seems sensible to me that we need to keep this perspective when dealing with all living creatures.<p>Anthropomorphizing and likening the consciousnesses of an ant to that of humans is, in my opinion, fraught with problems. For example, if we believed that ants perceived the world in the same way as we humans do and or that they were self-aware to the same degree as us then we could be in big trouble, as such an understanding would likely stop us taking action when they became pests (when, say, fire ants are imported into countries where they aren&#x27;t native).<p>We <i>do not</i> fully understand consciousnesses in ourselves nor are we able to put a measure on it, so attempting to extrapolate our degree of sentience to other organisms not only doesn&#x27;t make sense but it also could be dangerous to our own wellbeing, thus we should be very cautious until we have a much better understanding of what consciousness actually is.<p>Let me say categorically that is no excuse for being cruel and or to disregard the &#x27;feelings&#x27; of creatures irrespective of their &#x27;brain power&#x27;. We do however have to ensure that well meaning people who have strong anthropomorphic feelings are not able to set unrealistic rules in respect of living creatures that could be detrimental to our own wellbeing.<p>As I see it, honing an appropriate and proportionate response is our biggest challenge.",1714804681,,40255447,40254054,comment,

But those are different things! Those are what <i>we</i> would experience doing those things, but it doesn&#x27;t follow at all the other beings will just because they perform these activities.<p>A thought exercise is to imagine programming a little robot. It can play with balls because you program it to stimulate objects in its environment, and it has a heuristic called &quot;interesting&quot; that controls what it plays with. It can detect when it is damaged and avoid places where the damage happened (you can even call the variable where you store the quantity of damage &quot;pain&quot; if you want). It can remember places or objects by encoding characteristics about them and storing on the onboard flash drive. While none of that is at all easy, those are all things you could imagine programming without some great conceptual breakthrough. But you would probably not suspect your robot is conscious.<p>That&#x27;s not an argument that bees are <i>not</i> conscious, and as far I understand it, there&#x27;s no conceivable way to really know, and we don&#x27;t even really have a great definition of consciousness to begin with.

ChaitanyaSai,,"It helps to have both a computational understanding, and a computational perspective of what minds do to understand why consciousness is needed.<p>Consciousness is a consensus mechanism. I&#x27;ve co-authored a book where we talk about what&#x27;s the most computationally robust <i>and</i> biologically plausible model of consciousness. It is only now, two years after the book, that I realized that the best phrasing for what consciousness is must be one that takes into account the Truly Hard Problem of Consciousnss: Who is feeling it? 
With every other phrasing or definition the &quot;I&quot; is implicit and taken for granted. So the question becomes &quot;Why does this have to feel like anything?&quot;<p>The answer, it turns out, is that both experience and the experiencer are constructed together in a virtuous loop. You are a constellation of experiences. Consciousness is the consensus mechanism by which a chorus emerges in this constellation. And why is one needed? Because the decentralized entity that is you must act as one at all times, and especially when rare risks or outstanding opportunities present themselves. When we take the &quot;I&quot; for granted, we simply do not realize the staggeringly immense computational challenge it is to stitch this subjective self together. What sets apart this explanation is not just this broad-strokes perspective, but the biologically plausible mechanism by which top-down expectations (your past experiences) match up with bottom-up sensory data (ambiguous and potentially overwhelming reality)<p>More here: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saigaddam.medium.com&#x2F;consciousness-is-a-consensus-mechanism-2b399c9ec4b5"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;saigaddam.medium.com&#x2F;consciousness-is-a-consensus-me...</a>

retrac,,"Classic speech synthesis is interesting, in that relatively simple approaches, produce useful results.  Formant synthesis takes relatively simple sounds, and modifies them according to the various distinctions the human speech tract can make.  The basic vowel quality can be modelled as two sine waves that change over time.  (Nothing more complex than what&#x27;s needed to generate touch tone dialing tones, basically.)    Add a few types of buzzing or clicking noises before or after that for consonants, and you&#x27;re halfway there.  The technique predates computers; it&#x27;s basically the same technique used by the original voder [1] just under computer control.<p>Join that with algorithms which can translate English into phonetic tokens with relatively high accuracy, and you have speech synthesis.  Make the dictionary big enough, add enough finesse, and a few hundred rules about transitioning from phoneme to phoneme, and it&#x27;s produces relatively understandable speech.<p>Part of me feels that we are losing something, moving away from these classic approaches to AI.  It used to be that, to teach a machine how to speak, or translate, the designer of the system had to understand how language worked.  Sometimes these models percolated back into broader thinking about language.  Formant synthesis ended up being an inspiration to some ideas for how the brain recognizes phonemes.  (Or maybe that worked in both directions.)  It was thought, further advances would come from better theories about language, better abstractions.  Deep learning has produced far better systems than the classic approach, but they also offer little in terms of understanding or simplifying.<p>[1] <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voder"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Voder</a>",1714620328,,40232384,40231630,comment,"[40232918, 40232461, 40237333, 40237129, 40232490, 40238926, 40234246, 40233022]"

I&#x27;m currently developing a specialized UAV, and I&#x27;ve gotten to the point where I&#x27;ve got MCU-based FC hardware almost running that is based off of open source Pixhawk designs. But the long term plan is to introduce a variety of tasks that rely on computer vision and&#x2F;or machine learning, and so the general approach is to go with a companion computer. It seems the default choice for things like this in the prototype stage is a raspberry Pi or Jetson module, but I would really like to develop the entire system as a single module with an eye toward serial production, which means I&#x27;m looking at embedding an SOC, as opposed to wiring up an external module. And that has led me to look at the Snapdragon SOCs, in large part due to the GPU capabilities. But now I&#x27;m getting into unfamiliar territory, because I can&#x27;t do ordering&#x2F;research via digikey like I have done with everything else up until now.<p>When we&#x27;re talking about new development, what are the expectations that I should have for direct procurement of higher end components (this goes for Sony&#x2F;Samsung camera sensors too)?

Is it possible to get datasheets even if I&#x27;m not at that stage yet?<p>I get the feeling I&#x27;m stuck with the Jetson + Off-the-shelf camera approach until I can demonstrate the ability to mass produce and sell my existing designs, but it would be nice if I could find out more about how that is supposed to play out.",1714678863,,40240594,40233784,comment,"[40245228, 40240972, 40241110]"

kllrnohj,,"&gt; Qualcomm’s OpenCL runtime would unpredictably crash if a kernel ran for too long. Crash probability goes down if kernel runtimes stay well below a second. That’s why some of the graphs above are noisy. I wonder if Qualcomm’s Adreno 6xx command processor changes had something to do with it. They added a low priority compute queue, but I’m guessing OpenCL stuff doesn’t run as “low priority” because the screen will freeze if a kernel does manage to run for a while.<p>Very few (if any) mobile class GPUs actually support true preemption. Rather they are more like pseudo-cooperative, with suspend checks in between work units on the GPU. Desktop GPUs only got instruction-level preemption not <i>that</i> long ago - Nvidia first added it with Pascal (GTX 10xx), so mobile still lacking this isn&#x27;t surprising. It&#x27;s a big cost to pay for a relatively niche problem.<p>So the &quot;crash&quot; was probably a watchdog firing for failing to make forward progress at a sufficient rate and also why the screen would freeze.

exDM69,,"I wrote almost the exact same thing after seeing Sebastian Aaltonen&#x27;s original offset allocator repo which inspired me to write my own clone in Rust.<p>It&#x27;s possible to further improve the fragmentation characteristics if the maximum size of the memory to be allocated is known ahead of time. The original used a 5.3 &quot;floating point&quot; scheme for the free bins, but given the maximum size you can opt for 4.4 or 6.2 or whatever can cover the whole region, giving more dense (or sparse) allocation granularity as needed.<p>This same idea can also be extended to allocating texture atlas regions when the regions have power of two size. 256 bins can cover all possible texture sizes that GPUs can handle, so you can get hard O(1) texture packing.<p>I&#x27;m also curious about making something like this work as a general purpose allocator (as alluded to by the README). For that it would be necessary to make a reverse lookup from pointer address to allocation handle, which would require something like a red-black tree covering the address space, which would no longer be 0(1). If anyone has ideas on this front, I would be happy to hear them.<p>This algorithm is so clever and kind of a game changer. Allocating and freeing are fast real time operations (only dozens of CPU cycles and a few memory writes). It kind of makes &quot;bump allocators&quot; obsolete because this allocator is almost as fast but supports trimming and freeing allocations as well.

Another anecdote I always remembered was that the lead balls fired by early muskets were often more deadly than modern firearms because they were so slow and heavy that when they got into the body they wouldn&#x27;t pass through but instead roll around along the bones and mess up the insides, similar to the modern street lore about .22 pistols being the worst to get shot with.

drgo,,"Too many important missing details, so it is hard to assess the validity of the results. Generally, observational studies of this kind are hotbed for false alarms and false hopes. The difficulty is that on average the people who sleep well and are physically active are also the people who eat well, have higher incomes and better access to healthcare. So it is hard to isolate one factor as the most responsible for the observed outcomes (the problem of confounding). Also, even if the observed average effects are real, it is hard to predict how that would translate into an effect at the individual level because the effect may depend on age, gender, genes, frailty, environmental factors etc (the problem of effect modification or interaction). Finally, because no actual data is shown, we do not know reliable and reproducible the results are (the problem of random error). Be careful of drawing any conclusions from observational studies especially studies of unknown methods and no published results.

zbentley,,"I think Puppet hits the sweet spot in this area. It&#x27;s default is a series of idempotent &quot;here&#x27;s how this should be configured&quot; statements, but it can be used as a full programming language in its more advanced capacity, and it&#x27;s reasonably extensible (in Puppet-lang and Ruby) to support specific custom applications.<p>I also think that the facts&#x2F;manifest&#x2F;apply separation is conducive to nicely testable infra code, and useful dry-run output.<p>I&#x27;m always surprised that Puppet isn&#x27;t still more popular. My theory is that it&#x27;s passed over because of its age&#x2F;cruftiness&#x2F;bad vibes in some cases, and that  a couple of technical flaws mess it up for some key userbases:<p>For folks who just want a quick-to-start management tool for a small set of config, Puppet&#x27;s ugly and clunky client&#x2F;server model and the hyper-YAML-ification of its best practices (which is pursued to a fault by the community, and not helped by the Hiera pitch that the Puppet stack can also be sort of an asset tracking&#x2F;catalog system) make small-scale usage and prototyping hard. Puppet doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be used that way (it can be used just like pyinfra&#x2F;Ansible with a local-apply or via Bolt, hitting a nice sweet spot between ad-hoc&#x2F;non-idempotent commands and nice declarative&#x2F;idempotent Puppet code), but I think the puppetmaster&#x2F;hiera-all-the-things legacy in the community does Puppet and potential new users a disservice.<p>From the other side, I think a lot of more cloud-oriented users looking for a &quot;better Terraform for server state&quot; end up annoyed by the quality of modules on the Puppet forge and Puppet&#x27;s lack of a statefile equivalent (meaning that it doesn&#x27;t support deletes or infrastructure state snapshots in the same way TF does).",1714494011,,40212747,40211655,comment,"[40213333, 40218904, 40213950, 40216659, 40217121]"

Not sure this is the fix, but hopefully the story isn’t over.  In my experience the maintenance of cm codebases never, ever stops.  At first I thought it was a matter of expertise, but experts typically agree and just call it the cost of doing business.<p>Shelve something for three months and it will break on the next run, on the same os&#x2F;host where it used to work.  Blame the package manager, blame the os choice, or the cm tool.

0xbadcafebee,,"so, it&#x27;s Ansible...?<p>Configuration Management tools (that&#x27;s what this, and Ansible, are) are a nice idea, but get very complicated very quickly. The tools themselves get complicated, the configuration gets complicated, you&#x27;re constantly finding ways that the state gets broken that you need to re-incorporate into your script, it has to work in a variety of states, and you have to keep re-running and re-running and re-running it, monitoring for problems, investigating, fixing. Very complex, lots of maintenance, lots of potential problems. The &quot;Pets&quot; model from the phrase &quot;Cattle, not Pets.&quot; I <i>strongly</i> recommend you do not raise Pets.<p>Instead, use Immutable Infrastructure: build an immutable image one time that works one way. Deploy that image. If you need to change it, change the build script, build a new image (with a new version), deploy a new instance with the new image, take the old one out back and shoot it.

HanClinto,,"This is a really fascinating paper.<p>&gt; Our hypothesis is that, across a wide range of harmful prompts, there is a single intermediate feature which is instrumental in the model’s refusal. In other words, many particular instances of harmful instructions lead to the expression of this &quot;refusal feature,&quot; and once it is expressed in the residual stream, the model outputs text in a sort of &quot;should refuse&quot; mode.<p>At first blush it strikes me as a tenuous hypothesis, but really cool that it holds up. Fantastic work!<p>&gt; 1) Run the model on  harmful instructions and  harmless instructions, caching all residual stream activations at the last token position
&gt; 2) Compute the difference in means between harmful activations and harmless activations.<p>This is dirt-simple, but awesome that it works!<p>&gt; We can implement this as an inference-time intervention: every time a component c (e.g. an attention head) writes its output c out ∈ R d model to the residual stream, we can erase its contribution to the &quot;refusal direction&quot; ^r. We can do this by computing the projection of c out onto ^r, and then subtracting this projection away:
&gt; Note that we are ablating the same direction at every token and every layer. By performing this ablation at every component that writes the residual stream, we effectively prevent the model from ever representing this feature.<p>This is definitely the &quot;big-hammer&quot; approach, and while it no doubt would give the best results, I wonder if simply ablating the refusal vector at the final activation layer would be sufficient...? I would be interested in seeing experiments about this -- if that were the case, then this would certainly be easier to reproduce, because the lift would be much lower.<p>Regardless, I&#x27;m still somewhat new to LLMs, but it feels like this is the sort of paper that we should be able to reproduce in something like llama.cpp without too much trouble...? And the best part is, there&#x27;s no retraining &#x2F; fine-tuning involved -- we simple need to feed in a number of prompts that we want to find the common refusal vector for, a number of innocuous prompts, mash them together, and then feed that in as an additional parameter for the engine to ablate at inference time.

contingencies,,"&lt;opine&gt;Team is mostly BS. The chances that even a really good investor, who is not actually in the game, can accurately determine an early stage startup&#x27;s commercial trajectory by magically intuiting from highly condensed summaries of multiple people&#x27;s multiple decades of nuanced experience, is near zero. Yes, there is insight to be had there, especially at the pointy end of 80&#x2F;20, but there are far more significant factors in most cases. Long term VCs will tend to overstate the importance of character due to survivor bias (ie. the successful follow-ons are the only founders they really get to know).<p>IMHO most early stage investment is made based on hunches and hand-waving after doing generalist macro assessments of particular industries or trends. Frequently, faddish. GP&#x27;s will often do this, raise a fund around it, then associates are sent out to get deal-flow and execute. Many startups will be get selected from an available pool with the established investment theme. This capital is largely sacrificial, and high miss rates are expected.<p>Where things get serious at the personal level is in the mid to later stages where you start to see bigger figures being moved about and investors want a shepherd for their capital who has proven stable and long haul capable - things like the capacity not to suddenly live beyond their means, lose focus, drop it all and go to Vegas, crash and burn at HR management, or break down at the first signs of difficulty. That said, you also get mechanics being added like tranched deployment and fiscal&#x2F;management oversight (eg. board seats) which are highly effective at mitigating risk even in a low-trust scenario. Most VCs are early stage and never play at this level.<p><i>To put it bluntly: early stage is mostly noise. Mid to later stage, if they want the deal, they&#x27;ll make it happen.</i> It&#x27;s your job to be so damn good they can&#x27;t help themselves.&lt;&#x2F;opine&gt;",1714771638,,40252577,40244911,comment,[40253017]

JumpCrisscross,,"&quot;In 2005, CMS announced requirements for testing of electric-powered wheelchairs as part of efforts to modernize coding (5–7). In this century, CMS, in what might be classified by some as an uncharacteristic move, has provided leadership in evidence-based classification of wheelchairs.<p>Globally, the International Standards Organization (ISO) manages the wheelchair standards. ISO and the RESNA standards committee work collaboratively. ISO and RESNA have often been driven by outside sources to expedite their work and to address needs of consumers and other organizations. In the 1990s, the European Community Medical Device Directive provided impetus to make a number of changes to ISO standards and to create new standards in response to stricter regulation. The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) went its own direction for a while and over time, CEN and ISO standards have begun to merge. American National Standards Institute (ANSI)&#x2F;RESNA was a driving force for a long time and often had different standards than ISO. However, this has dwindled in the past decade. Concomitantly, the wheelchair industry has exploded over the past 10 years, and the standards have simply not kept pace. There is a clear and present need for change in standards development and support in the United States.<p>Most of the participants in wheelchair standards development are employed by the wheelchair industry, an inherent conflict. Unfortunately, wheelchair users and clinicians have traditionally not had the financial support to participate in sufficient numbers. Interestingly, the same companies that participate in the standards committees develop internal tests not represented by ISO or RESNA as part of their product development programs to protect them against legal liability.

RecycledEle,,"I deal with wheelchairs, electric wheelchairs, oxygen systems, CPAPs, spirometry, and more every day.<p>Electric wheelchairs are built to be very rugged and dirt simple.<p>There are 2 problems:<p>The first problem is insurance. People expect their insurance to cover everything. If they need a new set of 35 AH SLA batteries, they will throw their old chair away and ask for a new chair on insurance.<p>The second problem is that wheelchair users are disabled. As an able-bodied nerd with a socket set and a few wrenches, I can repair an electric wheelchair. A disabled person usually can not do that. They can not even follow the (good) advice to use an external charger instead of the (garbage) charger built into most wheelchairs; they physically can not get to the relevant parts.<p>Home oxygen companies send people out on short notice to debug, repair, or replace home oxygen equipment. If you want insurance to cover electric wheelchairs, then rent them instead of selling them and include service visits.<p>The problem with shipping an electric wheelchair back for service is that this thing weighs almost 100 pounds without batteries and is a very odd shape. Before anyone complains, you want it to be heavy so it will not tip over when the human (who is high up) leans over, takes a corner, or drives sideways on a slope.<p>If you want a less-insurance-intensive solution, pass a right-to-repair law that (1) requires all electric wheelchair parts to be marked with a manufacturer and part number, and (2) requires all electric wheelchair makers to sell parts for a decade or two after they stop selling the chairs. If they use industry-standard parts, and mark the parts as such, they should be relieved of the obligation to carry the parts for 20 years. Here&#x27;s an example: Include a label on the chair saying that all bolts are either m6x60mm or m4x25mm and that all red and black electrical connectors are PP75 series Anderson Power Poles.<p>Here is a case that drove me nuts: I was dealing with an electric wheelchair that had some odd version of Anderson PowerPoles connecting the batteries and motors. These connectors had been knock-offs, and the reseller of these (Chinese-made) connectors lost a patent lawsuit to Anderson (before their patent expired.) One connector broke and was impossible to replace. I would gladly pay $100 for a single connector, but they do not exist. Before someone says to replace both ends of the connector, this is a connector mounted in a custom bracket with almost zero clearance as the chair&#x27;s seat fits right on top of the bracket, connectors, and wires.",1714770054,,40252341,40250056,comment,"[40253266, 40252680, 40252624]"

jmyeet,,"Private equity is great for exposing the flaws in our economic system. The consequences are of course awful and it would be better that they didn&#x27;t happen. But since they are happening, hopefully more people will start to realize it. When exposed to this kind of thing you can generally have one of two reactions:<p>The first is that you say that this kind of thing is good. It&#x27;s all part of capitalism. The market will work it out. People will say this kind of thing with a straight face.<p>The second is to say that it is bad. But why is it bad?<p>The first stage is you believe that there are bad apples. Private equity is simply a few bad actors who may or may not need to be dealth with by way of legislation, regulation and&#x2F;or prosecution. Lots of people believe this because they still fundamentally believe in our current economic system.<p>The second stage is you realize that private equity isn&#x27;t an outlier and isn&#x27;t a few bad apples. It is exactly what our system is designed to produce: to financialize and rent-seek in every aspect of our lives as a means of extracting wealth from the poor to the already vastly wealthy.<p>Private equity is taking over every aspect of your life by buying up homes, mobile home parks, vets, medical practices, hospitals, etc. There probably isn&#x27;t a single aspect of our lives that hasn&#x27;t been tainted by private equity.<p>And the playbook is exactly the same:<p>1. Jack up the prices, usually by cornering a market by either buying up all the competition or through legislatively creating enclosures;<p>2. Cut costs. Use noncompete agreements and and the like to suppress wages; and<p>3. Load up the entity with exploding debt and sell it to the market before the debt explodes.<p>This is capitalism working as intended. No more, no less.<p>On wheelchairs in particular, it&#x27;s truly disgusting what we as a society put wheelchair users through. One of the most egeregious examples is how airlines will routinely destroy wheelchairs.<p>We are steadily marching towrads a future where almost all of us will be a permanent underclass devoid of any kind of security.

mcconaughey,,"Ignoring the fact that this article doesn&#x27;t clearly state the &quot;evidence&quot; that the FTC found in this &quot;conspiracy&quot;, it misunderstands what occurred with US Shale producers from 2010-now.<p>In the 2010s, US Shale Producers got hyped up on strong oil prices and the explosion of fracking. They massively overproduced, leading to the price cratering and a large majority of producers going out of business. Oil and gas was in severe distress from the late 2010s to the negative price drama in 2020.<p>When prices rebounded in early 2020s, there was a lot of scar tissue in the industry about overproduction. Producers are now extremely conservative. They are also well aware that clean energy is on the horizon and want to draw out this good cycle as long as they can.<p>Opposite to what the conspiracy theory states, OPEC and US Shale do not want prices to go too high in the short term, as this shock would accelerate the clean energy transition. They definitely want strong prices, but this $80-100 range is probably the sweet spot. Below $80, they might pull back, which is what we see from OPEC. But this certainly isn&#x27;t some &quot;conspiracy&quot; to elevate oil to $200&#x2F;barrel. These participants are sophisticated and are not that shortsighted.<p>I think the typical Democrat-Party view that &quot;oil bad&quot; and &quot;oil corrupt&quot; lacks nuance.

This is essentially a wealth transfer to banks and their owners while hurting individuals and businesses to stifle economic activity. This is what we always do. Why? Because capital owners demand it. The other way cannot be tolerated or entertained.<p>The second way is taxation. Some countries (eg Spain) enacted a windfall profits tax. Unlike interest rate hikes, taxation only targets <i>profitable</i> corporations. It allows a government to redistribute wealth to those who most need it, fund infrastructure and so on. And it disproportionately affects those who price gouging for massive profits, such as in the case of the oil and gas industry. Companies may reinvest profits into their business to avoid these excessive taxes. Great. Perfect. Love to see it.<p>This latest price-fixing scandal is going to turn into a huge deal.

Majromax,,"The math seems off to me here.  In particular:<p>&gt;&gt; So here is the deal: If you have 16,000 GPUs, and you have a blended average of on-demand (50 percent), one year (30 percent), and three year (20 percent) instances, then that works out to $5.27 billion in GPU rental income over four years with an average cost of $9.40 per hour for the H100 GPUs.<p>This makes a very strong assumption that the rental cost of an H100 will not change over the next four years.  This is wildly optimistic.  Instead, we can infer expected prices by looking at the differential rates for one and three-year commitments:<p>&gt;&gt;  We estimated the one year reserved instance cost $57.63 per hour, or $7.20 per GPU-hour, and we know that the published price for the three year reserved instance is $43.16, or $5.40 per GPU-hour.<p>On the margin, the cloud provider should be indifferent between an on-demand rental, a one-year reservation, and a three-year reservation.  That implies that three consecutive one-year reservations should provide about the same income as the three-year reservation.^[1]<p>Someone who places a three-year commitment will spend $16.20 per hour in one year, over three years.  The one-year commitment is $7.20 per hour in one year, over one year.  Subtract the two, and we get the residual of $9.00, and divide by the two years remaining in the contract to get $4.50.<p>With this rough calculation, the two-year, one-year forward price of the H100 is about $4.50&#x2F;hr.  If we further assume that the price changes per year with a constant ratio (0.72), we can break that up the per-hour, one-year reservation prices as $7.20 (today), $5.22 (one year from now), and $3.78 (two years from now).<p>Going further into speculation and applying this ratio to rental revenue on the whole, that &quot;$5.27b over four years&quot; instead becomes $3.47b.  Still a reasonable multiple of the purchased infrastructure cost, but it&#x27;s less outlandish and emphasizes the profit potential of moving first in this sector (getting those long-term commitments while it&#x27;s still a seller&#x27;s market).<p>[1 — I&#x27;m ignoring the option-value in the one-year commitment, which allows the customer to seek a better deal after twelve months.  This option-value is minimal of the GPU cloud is expected to be at-capacity forever, such that the provider can replace customers easily.]",1714741712,,40247274,40246398,comment,"[40248226, 40248058, 40248856]"
latchkey,,"Great article. I&#x27;m in the process of building this business myself, so I&#x27;m intimately aware of everything in the article. Just keep in mind that a lot of the math is back of the napkin guesses. All of this is managed on personal relationships and deals with the vendors and much of the pricing that actually gets set, isn&#x27;t made public.<p>Our first offering is the AMD MI300x instead of Nvidia or Intel products. But, unlike all of my competitors, we are not picking sides. Our unique value prop is that we eventually plan to offer the best of the best compute of anything our customers want. Effectively building a varied super computer for rent, with bare metal access to everything you need and white glove service and support. In essence, we are the cap&#x2F;opex for businesses that don&#x27;t want to take on this risk themselves.<p>What people don&#x27;t understand is how difficult and capital intensive to deploy and manage large scale compute, especially on the high end cutting edge. Gone are the days of just racking&#x2F;stacking a few servers. This stuff is way more complicated and involved. It is rife with firmware bugs, limitations, and hardware failures.<p>The end of the article says some nonsense about a glut of GPU capacity. I do have to call that out. It isn&#x27;t going to happen for a long while at least. The need for compute is growing exponentially.

h0l0cube,,"There&#x27;s a lot of interesting stuff in this article and I came back to the comments on this to see if the discourse had corrected itself.  Instead people are still taking affront (why?) to the article being an interview of a researcher, even though they are the common thread to a bunch of really interesting research.  Here&#x27;s some interesting things I&#x27;d like people to chime in on:<p>&gt; We are also super excited about how the brain controls the transition from acute to chronic pain. We use our pain scale to measure the pain level in a mouse and then take a snapshot of the mouse’s brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging. We image the animals every day to find brain activity patterns that underlie the transition from acute to chronic pain. Once we find them, we can try to change them to alter the course of chronic pain. We’re interested in the emotional as well as sensory components of this pain.<p>&gt; When we activated neurons through the skin on the mice’s backs, the animals behaved as if they were being stroked there. That launched the whole project. We did a lot more behavioral tests and traced the pathway for social touch from the skin to the spinal cord to the reward centers in the brain.<p>&gt; What if we could turn on these neurons with a skin cream to improve mental health — say, to offset the harm caused by social isolation or to treat anxiety or depression? When I gave a talk about this in December, the psychiatrists and neuropharmacologists in the audience were very enthusiastic about the therapeutic potential.<p>&gt; We’re also interested in them because mole rats do not feel some forms of pain. For example, they show no pain response to the molecule capsaicin, the active ingredient in hot peppers, which is quite painful to most mammals. They have receptors in their skin that respond to capsaicin, so I hypothesize that the animals have brain pathways that shut down the pain. If we can find and tap into those signals, we might find a new way to block pain.<p>They are taking a multidisciplinary approach to researching an understudied field, and it&#x27;s fascinating.

salamo,,"Neat demo. It seems like there may be a few things happening in tandem.<p>I uploaded a picture of a forest and it came back with visually similar images. So the first thing it might be doing is some kind of KNN, and if the pictures have location labels associated applying some sort of weighted average to determine GPS coordinates. This is pretty cool.<p>I also tried flipping the image horizontally, and it came back with the same images. So their embedding isn&#x27;t based off of exact matches (good) and seems to be invariant to some basic translations (good). It also seems like it&#x27;s directly extracting visual features from the image. This can be done with something like Blip[0].<p>Then I uploaded a screenshot from Magic School Bus. It still extracted information to guess the &quot;location&quot; of the cartoon (San Francisco, which is wrong). So that&#x27;s probably how it works.<p>I also found the text output is similar in some ways with OpenGVLab InternViT [1]. So perhaps this or something like it is being used to extract features.<p>And of course there may be an LLM on top of these extracted features with some sort of prompt template.

ffo,,"Even though I work at a company that also supplies passkeys support to its customers, I feel it is worth for people to have a read of (1). The platform lock-in is a real problem we already see.

Oh, and if a customer ever wants to change the domain name for branding related stuff, is also where the fun starts.<p>My 2 cents are that passwords&#x2F;2fa, passkeys, federation and maybe soon verifiable credentials are concepts that will work for a long time in parallel.

grose,,"Very thorough article, nice! I&#x27;ll add some other pain points I experienced:<p>- You need to let users register more than 1 passkey, but how to show them which is which? There are lists like this one[1] and FIDO provides a (maybe irrelevant?) list on their site[2] stuck inside of a JWT. I ended up using that JSON list + registration date + browser UA that registered it + &quot;currently using&quot; indicator when the current session derives from that specific passkey. Still kind of feels like a mess.<p>- The popular libraries seem to follow a kind of &quot;shadow spec&quot; where they agreed on using the URL-friendly variant of base64, which doesn&#x27;t have native browser support. Not a big deal (just a couple helper functions needed) but kind of confusing if you&#x27;re trying to implement the client or server bits from scratch. [Edit: as explained by a reply below, this is part of the actual spec!]<p>- I still don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s possible to use both usernameless and usernameful passkeys simultaneously. The APIs seem to be mutually exclusive, differentiated by some options (some of which are already deprecated?) and requiring empty lists to be passed in certain places.

Etherlord87,,"In many tiled video games, roads, tracks and other paths tend to be designed without the knowledge on 2nd derivative continuity (or ignoring it for aesthetic reasons). So it would consist of straight segments, and rounded segments (and maybe some intersections). The rounded segments will be simply quarters of a circle. The problem with this is that while the path is continuous (no teleportation), and the velocity is continuous (no sudden direction change), the acceleration isn&#x27;t continuous - there&#x27;s no acceleration on the straight segments, and then suddenly there is acceleration on the rounded segment, and that acceleration, for an arc, is constant. In real life there&#x27;s an easing added to the paths of e.g. railways, so that the sudden acceleration doesn&#x27;t surprise passengers. In tiles you could also design the turns to be C² continuous, but it  might be aesthetically displeasing by looking like being handdrawn rather than mathematically constructed.<p>I&#x27;m saying all this, because it seems Hobby&#x27;s algorithm is something designed precisely to construct splines that maximize this aesthetically pleasing C¹ continuity... However it tends to explode splines by favoring arc connections, so I think some optimization is needed to limit that behavior: <a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;W9ssWTu.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;i.imgur.com&#x2F;W9ssWTu.png</a>",1714691585,,40242377,40241057,comment,"[40243679, 40243892, 40255898, 40246500, 40242821, 40245707]"
raphlinus,,"Most of the applications of Hobby&#x27;s spline would be better served by using Euler spirals instead. These are G2 continuous and have less curvature varation (in fact, Euler spirals are solutions of the Minimum Variation Curvature problem). I think it&#x27;s fair to characterize Hobby&#x27;s spline as an approximation to Euler spiral splines, just less expensive to compute.<p>I think there&#x27;s even more to be done on this topic. In particular, I think the tension should increase as angles go up, which can solve the &quot;flipping&quot; behavior you see with both Hobby and Euler spiral splines. This is true for the Adobe κ-curves paper (which considerably overstates the extent to which it&#x27;s the basis for the &quot;curvature&quot; tool in Adobe Illustrator; the latter has not to my knowledge been adequately documented).",1714708045,,40243830,40241057,comment,[40244186]

We’re building a small, focused, high performing frontend engineering team that works directly with the CEO leading the product. To help build this great team, we offer incredibly competitive compensation (based on Bay Area bands) and some interesting benefits(<a href=""https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers#benefits"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.streak.com&#x2F;careers#benefits</a>). We want you to do the best work of your career here, so you should expect high autonomy and ownership.<p>Lastly, we believe the traditional interview process isn’t well correlated with an engineers’ ability to ship product. Instead, our interview process mimics what it’s actually like to work here. It’s highly asynchronous, favors writing and involves building something useful. We think this will give you a really good insight into our team and company and of course lets us assess if you’ll thrive here.",1714581053,,40225547,40224213,comment,[40231091]

We are hiring for several roles, but the one I will highlight is what we call the Platforms Engineer. Some companies call this Site Reliability Engineering or Devops.<p>The main thing we do is take upstream software, build it, run it on our infrastructure, and then monitor it and optimize that setup. Some things that make this interesting are:<p>* Building automation that enables us to do this for many networks (50+ currently).
 * Doing this with high uptime, building automation for failover, etc.
 * Working with software that is on the one hand cutting-edge and doing interesting things (consensus algorithms, distributed systems, cryptography), but on the other hand that means it’s immature and often not easy to operate and monitor. Often we have to build custom tools, and dive into the source code of the project. We contribute patches upstream when it makes sense.
 * Some of these projects are exercising the limits of what a machine can do, we have to do some low-level investigation that requires understanding of what the Linux kernel and network hardware are doing to properly identify what’s going on.<p>We do have a small cloud footprint but run primarily on bare metal. We are looking for people who can not just configure services offered by the public clouds, but who deeply understand what lies below; people who could build their own cloud.

It is built in the historic city of Bruges by a small and dedicated team that aims to provide both instructors and students with better tools and ways to experience their course material.For our engineering team we are looking to hire one or more software engineers, both junior and senior, to help develop the software side of our platform. We are growing at an ever increasing speed which provides us with numerous interesting challenges to tackle and opportunities to make a meaningful difference.<p>* What are we looking for? *<p>We are looking for talented developers who have at least some experience with React and its ecosystem (Typescript, Plate, Vite, …) but are not afraid to do some work in the backend as well (Ruby&#x2F;Rails in our case).

It is important to note, however, that, since we are working in the Flemish educational market, we do expect you to speak Dutch or are in the process of learning Dutch.
Beyond that, we’d just love to have a chat to paint a broader picture and listen to what you can bring to the table!<p>* What do we offer? *<p>It goes without saying that you’d receive a competitive salary and all the social benefits you’d expect from a developer position. Beyond that, we offer a mix of remote work and working from our office in the city center of Bruges. We will also supply you with any development material you may need (Macbook, software, …). If you have any strong desires, we’d love to hear them as well.

In the US, we spend an average of over $12,500 per person each year on healthcare -- that’s almost twice what other developed countries spend. Healthcare in the US costs a staggering $4 trillion dollars per year, almost 1&#x2F;5 of our Nation’s entire economy. Yet with all this resource, our healthcare outcomes are poorer than other countries, people still can’t afford their healthcare, and our healthcare providers are burnt out.<p>Moreover, our healthcare is systemically unequal. People of color, lower income, and LGBTQ+ have demonstrably worse healthcare outcomes, a disparity grimly highlighted by the pandemic we’re living through now where people of color are three-times more likely to die from COVID-19.<p>How can this be, and how can we change it?<p>Nuna is tackling one of the most hardest problems in healthcare underlying the negative outcomes and disparities we see: how healthcare gets paid.<p>Today, hospitals only get paid when they do more-- more visits, more tests, more meds, more surgeries. Hopefully this helps patients get better, but regardless, the system gets paid. In fact, doing more is the only way to stay afloat.<p>But -- is this really the right set of incentives? Shouldn’t everyone get rewarded not just by doing more, but by when patients actually get better? Shouldn’t everyone have access to affordable, high quality care, and shouldn’t hospitals be rewarded when they deliver this care? And shouldn’t insurance companies get rewarded when they help ALL their patients get better?<p>Absolutely, yes. This concept is called Value-Based Care. In fact, healthcare as a whole has been trying to move in this direction for years, but making it all reality is deeply complex -- it is after all our healthcare. Nuna’s technology platform, our software apps, our vision, and our exceptionally talented team are collectively accelerating the healthcare system’s ability to make value-based care available to everyone.<p>In 2022, Nuna will power over $70B of healthcare payments for over 6.5M patients. We also leverage our data science and platform to direct patients to the best, culturally-matched, and accessible care providers for them. Additionally, we make it transparent and easy for both hospitals and insurers to see how they are performing in value-based care by spotlighting the patients or areas where they need to pay extra attention so that they can provide good care to all their patients and get rewarded.<p>Nuna is unique - we have brought together an exceptional team of over 200 people. We are the industry’s best in healthcare data, analytics, engineering, clinicians, and value based healthcare experts. We have joined forces to create a more equitable health system for everyone.<p>Our dreams and ambitions to change healthcare as we know it are big.

Well, the short of it is that you’d get unprecedented insight into how companies are started – with access to all the talks, constantly being around founders, and working directly with YC Group Partners. Our GPs are possibly the 12 most knowledgeable people in the world about starting companies. You’d be hard pressed to work here and NOT learn something new about startups every day – which might be helpful if you’re interested in starting a company yourself.<p>Software also touches everything YC does. When I went through YC in 2013, the core pieces of the YC batch were a dinner each week, a 1-1 with your group partner, and an end-of-batch Demo Day event to raise money. Today, YC offers so many software tools to help founders build their companies, including:<p>Demo Day website, which has helped founders raise $3B+ over the last 3 years
Work at a Startup, where 1000s of companies have hired from a pool of 1M+ job seekers
Bookface, a tool for YC founders to support and help each other build their companies<p>YC software runs kind of like a startup: we have a small engineering team (15 people) full of full-stack software developers (Rails, React, Postgres) who talk to our users, ship fast and iterate often. YC’s great for people who like to move fast and learn quickly. As a member of our team, you’d work with and learn from some pretty experienced people who were early at Facebook, Carta, Salesforce, Twilio and other top companies.<p>Many of us have also been founders, and seven former employees have gone on to start startups that were funded by YC. If you want to start a startup but don’t have a great idea yet, we welcome you to spend a couple years here to learn, and then launch your own. On the flip side, if you can see yourself writing code indefinitely, we’d love to keep you happy here at YC for a long time. Either one works for us.<p>Building software at YC isn’t for everyone – YC’s real product is the Batch program and the Group Partners’ advice and help for the life of your startup. Our software team is often in the background, helping scale YC’s ability to help more companies, and in a way that means <i>more</i> 1-1 attention and support for each founder. What keeps me motivated is continuing to scale and improve YC through software, and getting to work with some of the most kind and talented people of my 20+ year career.<p>If you have questions, I would love to answer them here. (It would help me understand how I can make our role &amp; work more clear!)
